# Opti-tool

Hello!


Aim of this project is to create a stand-alone tool to fetch data about questions from brainly sites in order to provide them in a more accessible and appealing way to a closed community of moderators.

  - Hiding inaccessible questions (aged/approved)
  - Subjects filter
  - #Help top-layer
  - Ranking (General)
  - UI (buttons for #help and #subjects-list [RWD : button for #ranking-list])
  - RWD support

### Version 1.3

##### Changes:
  - Added an error screen shown when Google Spreadsheets' response is too slow and the site cannot load its content properly
  - Moved .animated class from list elements to the whole #questionList

### Version 1.4

##### Changes:
  - Added full support for new 'weekly' rankings
  - Created tab-like button to switch between both rankings
